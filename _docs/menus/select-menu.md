## Select SMARTS...

SMARTS **(**SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification) is a more
general chemical language extension of SMILES. "Select SMARTS..."
allows you to use this chemical language to select various atoms, or
groups of atoms within the molecule. For example, typing "a" into the
dialog box and clicking ok will select all atoms with
aromaticity. More information can be found at the [Daylight SMARTS webpage](http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html).

This feauture only works with residues that were made using the peptide builder.
