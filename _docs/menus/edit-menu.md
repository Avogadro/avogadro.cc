## Undo

"Undo" will negate the last change to the document.

## Redo

"Redo" will recover the last change to the document.

## Cut

"Cut" will remove and copy a selection.

## Copy

"Copy" will create a duplicate of the entire molecule or a selection, and place it on a clipboard.

## Copy As

"Copy As" provides text representations of the molecules present in the viewing screen. For example, selecting "Copy As" and "SMILES", renders "C(=O)(C)C.O.O" as the output for the viewing screen below. This selection can then be pasted in a text document for external projects.
