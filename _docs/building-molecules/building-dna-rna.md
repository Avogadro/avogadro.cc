The DNA/RNA builder is under the "Build" menu and "Insert" submenu.

Select either DNA or RNA (1) and the rest of the window will update accordingly.

You can also control the number of bases per turn as shown (with defaults for A-DNA, B-DNA, Z-DNA, or RNA).

You can enter the sequence either by clicking the buttons, or by typing the one-letter codes directly. For DNA sequences (as shown here), you can insert either single-stranded or double-stranded DNA.

There we go -- the well-known DNA double-helix!
