We are very proud to announce the availability of Avogadro 1.91.0, the latest Beta
for Avogadro 2.0.

Avogadro 2 is a free, open source, cross-platform molecular editor
designed for flexible use in computational chemistry, molecular
modeling, bioinformatics, materials science, and related
areas. Packages are available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. The
source code source is available under the 3-clause BSD license.

This release has a lot of new work completed over the last year, including the results of our first Google Summer of Code where two students worked on projects under the program.
