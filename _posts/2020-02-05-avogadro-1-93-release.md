We are very proud to announce the availability of Avogadro 1.90.0, the latest Beta
for Avogadro 2.0.

Avogadro 2 is a free, open source, cross-platform molecular editor
designed for flexible use in computational chemistry, molecular
modeling, bioinformatics, materials science, and related
areas. Packages are available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. The
source code source is available under the 3-clause BSD license.

This release has a lot of new work completed over the last year, including the results of our first Google Summer of Code where two students worked on projects under the program.

If you use Avogadro or Avogadro 2, please consider citing the Avogadro paper: <http://www.jcheminf.com/content/4/1/17>

This is a community project and we couldn't have made this release
without you. Many thanks to all the contributors to Avogadro including
those of you who submitted feedback, bug reports, and code. We
acknowledge that the development of Avogadro 2 has been funded in part by a US
Army SBIR with the Engineering Research Development Center under
contract (W912HZ-12-C-0005) at Kitware, Inc.
