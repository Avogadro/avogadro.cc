Avogadro and [Open Chemistry](http://openchemistry.org) are part of Google Summer of Code 2018. In particular, Adarsh has been selected to contribute features on [Molecular Dynamics to Avogadro 2](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5506662769623040).

I think I speak for everyone that we’re excited to see more progress on Avogadro 2 this summer - and hopefully the first official release of Avogadro 2.0 this fall.
