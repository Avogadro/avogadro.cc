We recently posted our second "community survey" to gather feedback. 
The survey was highlighted on Twitter and on the
avogadro mailing lists.

## Quick Summary (tldr)

- Many users find Avogadro from a friend, peer or instructor (~45%)
- By far, most download binaries (>80%)
  - Many use package managers (42%)
- Responses were heavily from Linux (71%) and Mac (60%) users, despite most SourceForge downloads from Windows users (66%)
- Heavily educated, with >90% of responses with at least a graduate degree
- Many can code: >40% report Python knowledge, >10% report C/C++ knowledge
- High bias towards research applications
- Most responses use Avogadro frequently (~57% use at least weekly)
- Many complaints about stability, crashes, and scalability to large systems
- Some suggestions to add features that already exist!
- Over 80% haven't contributed previously
