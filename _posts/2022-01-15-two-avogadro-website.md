There is now a website to coordinate development on Avogadro2:

https://two.avogadro.cc/

Developer documentation on Avogadro2, including download links for beta releases and nightly 
builds, as well as Python plugin documentation and C++ API are now available.

We would greatly appreciate help in migrating user documentation from Avgoadro1,
teaching documents, and translation / internationalization.

If you can help, please introduce yourself on the [Avogadro forum](https://discuss.avogadro.cc)
